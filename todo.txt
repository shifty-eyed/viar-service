DONE - milestone1 - track one node and pass to unreal realtime
1. install 4 cameras - done
2. calibrate intrinsic each cam using new board 
3. calibrate extrinsic each of them (or all together)
4. make sure stereo pair selection works
5. print bigger aruco



ms2 - body tracking, narrow distance range, unreal realtime
1. better position cameras
2. make better calibration device, re-calibrate using new device
3. detect body parts with ai lib - ok
5. track body parts with tracking algs
6. improve message communication with unreal
7. unreal- control actor with skeleton



Secchi disk detection, use cv.canny corner detector

TODO:
- feature coordinates normalized to 0-1 with center in the middle
- aruco improvements:
    - use projected points
    - if >1 detected use mean
    - if close to center round to zero (0,0,0)
    - add world-space-offset configuaration for every aruco marker
- background subtraction, based on the static frame with no people
- costume for best detection
