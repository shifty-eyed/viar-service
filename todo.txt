DONE - milestone1 - track one node and pass to unreal realtime
1. install 4 cameras - done
2. calibrate intrinsic each cam using new board 
3. calibrate extrinsic each of them (or all together)
4. make sure stereo pair selection works
5. print bigger aruco



ms2 - body tracking, narrow distance range, unreal realtime
1. better position cameras
2. make better calibration device, re-calibrate using new device
3. detect body parts with ai lib - ok
5. track body parts with tracking algs
6. improve message communication with unreal
7. unreal- control actor with skeleton



Secchi disk detection, use cv.canny corner detector

TODO:
- smooth transition from tracked to detected body parts
  instead of replacing feature with newly detected, add it to stack,
  keep dictionary/history of last n detections
- look for better tracking alg
- feature coordinates normalized to 0-1 with center in the middle
- costume for best detection
- new idea: let model detect rough body parts and then within range of detected body part,
    find the precise marker, maybe tracking would not even needed


problematic situation:
when new detected coordinates are far from the last tracked coordinates
- solution: keep track of last n detections, if new detection is far from last tracked,
    use last tracked, if new detection is close to last tracked, use new detection
